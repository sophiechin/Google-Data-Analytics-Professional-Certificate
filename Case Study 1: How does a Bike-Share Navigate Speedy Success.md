### Case Study 1: How Does A Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?


## 1. Introduction

Cyclistic is a bike-share program that offers inclusive options such as reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making it accessible to people with disabilities. While most riders choose traditional bikes, about 8% use the assistive options. The program is popular for leisure rides, but around 30% of users also rely on it for daily commuting. Cyclistic aims to shift its marketing focus towards converting casual riders into annual members as they have proven to be more profitable. By analyzing historical bike trip data, the marketing team aims to understand the differences between annual members and casual riders, determine why casual riders would consider a membership, and explore the impact of digital media on marketing strategies.

## 2. Scenario

As a junior data analyst on the marketing team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago, the director of marketing believes that the company's success hinges on maximizing annual memberships. Your team's objective is to gain an understanding of how casual riders and annual members utilize Cyclistic bikes differently. With these insights, you will develop a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. However, your recommendations must be supported by compelling data insights and professional data visualizations in order to obtain approval from Cyclistic executives.

## 3. Data Analysis Process

In this case study, the six steps of the data analysis process will be used in order to solve this problem. Those 6 steps include:
1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Process
4. Analyze
5. Share
6. Act

### Step 1: Ask
**Key Task**: Create marketing tactics aimed at converting casual riders into Cyclistic members.

So here are the analysis questions that will help in the analysis:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. What are the causes that drive casual riders to buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media as a tool to convert casual riders to members?

For this case, Lily Moreno who is the director of marketing has assigned me as a junior data analyst to the first question: *How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?*

### Step 2: Prepare

This step will address the data source that will be used for the analysis and the organization of the data structure.

**Data Source**:  Cyclisticâ€™s historical trip data from Jan 2022 to Dec 2022 which is a public dataset published by Motivate International Inc. will be used to analyze and identify trends. [Click Here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) for the dataset.

**Data Information**: In the data source, there are 12 files in total following the naming convention of *"YYYYMM-divvy-tripdata"*. Each file contains data for a specific month, including other details such as ride ID, bike type, start time, end time, start station, end station, start location, end location, and member status. The corresponding column names are:
- ride_id
- rideable_type
- started_at
- ended_at
- start_station_name
- start_station_id
- end_station_name
- end_station_id
- start_lat
- start_lng
- end_lat
- end_lng
- member_casual

### Step 3: Process

**Tool**: Google BigQuery is used to combine the total 12 files into one dataset.

#### Data Combination

Tables representing 12 CSV files have been uploaded to the 2022_tripdata dataset. To help with data combination, the following SQL query is implemented in order to combine all 12 files into a single dataset. A new table named ***"all_tripdata"*** has been generated using the following code.:

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `2022_tripdata.all_tripdata` AS 
(
  SELECT * FROM '202201_tripdata`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `202202_tripdata`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `202203_tripdata`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `202204_tripdata`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `202205_tripdata`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `202206_tripdata`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `202207_tripdata`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `202208_tripdata`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `202209_tripdata`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `202210_tripdata`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `202211_tripdata`
  UNION ALL
  SELECT * FROM `202212_tripdata`
);
```

Then, to check the total row numbers, we perform this SQL query. The new dataset ***"all_tripdata"*** holds a total of 5,667,717 data rows encompassing the entire year:

```
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records
FROM `2022_tripdata.all_tripdata`;
```
We perform the following code to show the first 10 rows of the dataset in order to understand the dataset better

```
SELECT * `FROM 2022_tripdata.all_tripdata` LIMIT 10;
```
#### Data Exploration

In order to do data exploration, the first thing to do is to check the data type to observe the inconsistencies. After checking, we have seen that the entire dataset has the ride_id as the primary key:

```
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM `2022_tripdata`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS
WHERE table_name = 'all_tripdata';

```
To help ensure data cleanness, we have to check if the dataset has any null values in any column. However, it appears that there are no ***null*** values in the dataset:

```
SELECT COUNT(*) - COUNT(ride_id) ride_id,
 COUNT(*) - COUNT(rideable_type) rideable_type,
 COUNT(*) - COUNT(started_at) started_at,
 COUNT(*) - COUNT(ended_at) ended_at,
 COUNT(*) - COUNT(start_station_name) start_station_name,
 COUNT(*) - COUNT(start_station_id) start_station_id,
 COUNT(*) - COUNT(end_station_name) end_station_name,
 COUNT(*) - COUNT(end_station_id) end_station_id,
 COUNT(*) - COUNT(start_lat) start_lat,
 COUNT(*) - COUNT(start_lng) start_lng,
 COUNT(*) - COUNT(end_lat) end_lat,
 COUNT(*) - COUNT(end_lng) end_lng,
 COUNT(*) - COUNT(member_casual) member_casual
FROM `2022_tripdata.all_tripdata`;
```

After checking the null values, we also need to check if the dataset has any duplicate values. By performing this following code, it appears that we have no duplicate values:

```
SELECT COUNT(ride_id) - COUNT(DISTINCT ride_id) AS duplicate_rows
FROM `2022_tripdata.all_tripdata`;

```

Retrieve the records of the rideable_type column to see the different bike types: electric_bike, classical_bike, docked_bike

```
SELECT DISTINCT rideable_type, COUNT(rideable_type) AS trip_type
FROM `2022_tripdata.combined_data`
GROUP BY rideable_type;
```
Retrieve the records of the member_casual column to check the different member types: member, casual

```
SELECT DISTINCT member_casual, COUNT(*) AS count_member_type
FROM your_dataset_name.your_table_name
GROUP BY member_casual;
```
The trip starts and end times are indicated in the format YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss UTC in the columns *"started_at"* and *"ended_at."* By introducing a new column called ***"ride_length"*** we can compute the total trip duration. It is necessary to exclude 5360 trips with a duration exceeding one day and 122283 trips with a duration less than a minute or end times earlier than start times.

Columns such as ***"day_of_week"*** and ***"month"*** can offer valuable insights into analyzing trips at various times throughout the year.

To enhance data integrity, 833064 rows with missing values in both "start_station_name" and "start_station_id" should be eliminated. Similarly, 892742 rows with missing values in both ***"end_station_name"*** and ***"end_station_id"*** and 5858 rows with missing values in both ***"end_lat"*** and ***"end_lng"*** should also be removed.

```
SELECT started_at, ended_at
FROM `2022_tripdata.all_tripdata`
LIMIT 20;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS longer_than_1_day
FROM `2022_tripdata.all_tripdata`
WHERE (
  EXTRACT(HOUR FROM (ended_at - started_at)) * 60 +
  EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM (ended_at - started_at)) +
  EXTRACT(SECOND FROM (ended_at - started_at)) / 60) >= 1440;   -- longer than 1 day - total rows = 5360

SELECT COUNT(*) AS less_than_a_minute
FROM `2022_tripdata.all_tripdata`
WHERE (
  EXTRACT(HOUR FROM (ended_at - started_at)) * 60 +
  EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM (ended_at - started_at)) +
  EXTRACT(SECOND FROM (ended_at - started_at)) / 60) <= 1;      -- less than 1 minute - total rows = 122283
```

In the dataset, there are 833,064 rows where both the ***"start_station_name"*** and ***"start_station_id"*** values are missing.

```
SELECT DISTINCT start_station_name
FROM `2022_tripdata.all_tripdata`
ORDER BY start_station_name;

SELECT COUNT(ride_id) AS start_station_null   
FROM `2022_tripdata.all_tripdata`
WHERE start_station_name IS NULL OR start_station_id IS NULL;

```

There are also 892,742 rows in which both the ***"end_station_name"*** and ***"end_station_id"*** values are absent.

```
SELECT DISTINCT end_station_name
FROM `2022_tripdata.all_tripdata`
ORDER BY end_station_name;

SELECT COUNT(ride_id) AS end_station_null
FROM `2022_tripdata.all_tripdata`
WHERE end_station_name IS NULL OR end_station_id IS NULL;

```
In the dataset, there are a total of 5,858 rows where both the ***"end_lat"*** and ***"end_lng"*** values are missing.
```
SELECT COUNT(ride_id) AS end_loc_null
FROM `2022_tripdata.all_tripdata`
WHERE end_lat IS NULL OR end_lng IS NULL;
```
#### Data Cleaning

In step, a new table will be created for cleaned data which is easier for analysis. Therefore, the following steps are implemented:

 - First, any rows containing missing values are removed from the dataset.
 - 3 new columns, namely ***"ride_length"*** to indicate the trip duration, ***"day_of_week"*** to specify the day of the week, and ***"month"*** to represent the month, are added.
 - Trips with durations less than a minute and longer than a day are excluded, leading to the removal of a total of 1,375,912 rows during this process.


Create a new table called ***"alldata_cleaned"*** with the following code:
```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `2022_tripdata.alldata_cleaned` AS (
  SELECT 
    a.ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, 
    ride_length,
    CASE EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM started_at) 
      WHEN 1 THEN 'Sun'
      WHEN 2 THEN 'Mon'
      WHEN 3 THEN 'Tue'
      WHEN 4 THEN 'Wed'
      WHEN 5 THEN 'Thu'
      WHEN 6 THEN 'Fri'
      WHEN 7 THEN 'Sat'    
    END AS day_of_week,
    CASE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM started_at)
      WHEN 1 THEN 'Jan'
      WHEN 2 THEN 'Feb'
      WHEN 3 THEN 'Mar'
      WHEN 4 THEN 'Apr'
      WHEN 5 THEN 'May'
      WHEN 6 THEN 'Jun'
      WHEN 7 THEN 'Jul'
      WHEN 8 THEN 'Aug'
      WHEN 9 THEN 'Sep'
      WHEN 10 THEN 'Oct'
      WHEN 11 THEN 'Nov'
      WHEN 12 THEN 'Dec'
    END AS month,
    start_station_name, end_station_name, 
    start_lat, start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual
  FROM `2022_tripdata.all_tripdata` a
  JOIN (
    SELECT ride_id, (
      EXTRACT(HOUR FROM (ended_at - started_at)) * 60 +
      EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM (ended_at - started_at)) +
      EXTRACT(SECOND FROM (ended_at - started_at)) / 60) AS ride_length
    FROM `2022_tripdata.all_tripdata`
  ) b 
  ON a.ride_id = b.ride_id
  WHERE 
    start_station_name IS NOT NULL AND
    end_station_name IS NOT NULL AND
    end_lat IS NOT NULL AND
    end_lng IS NOT NULL AND
    ride_length > 1 AND ride_length < 1440
);
```

Set ***"ride_id"*** as the primary key for the new table and remove rows:

```
ALTER TABLE `2022_tripdata.alldata_cleaned`
ADD PRIMARY KEY(ride_id) NOT ENFORCED;

SELECT COUNT(ride_id) AS no_of_rows
FROM `2022_tripdata.alldata_cleaned`;
```
